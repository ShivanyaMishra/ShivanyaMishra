# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Shivanya Mishra

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently pursuing my MCA and working as a **Data Tool Developer**, passionate about turning raw data into clean insights using Python.

ðŸ§  I love building automation tools, cleaning messy datasets, and creating smart scripts to save time and effort.

ðŸ”§ Technologies I work with:
- Python (pandas, openpyxl, datetime, os)
- Excel Automation
- Power BI (Dashboards, KPI tracking)
- MySQL (basics)
- Flask (backend scripting)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic web)

ðŸ’¼ My favorite projects:
- **Databook** â€“ Excel data parser + WhatsApp message formatter  
- **FileNavigator** â€“ Auto file sorter with secure vault  
- **Expense Tracker** â€“ Python tool to log, clean, and format expenses  
- **SCORPIO** â€“ Chatbot + voice assistant (Flask-based)
